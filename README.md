## Overview

* Concise spring animation expressions.
* Local time state, not part of your model.
* Calculates only while animating.
* This then that style timeline helper.


## The approach

React style UIs have many advantages,
but it is not always clear how to animate them.
Existing animation libraries focus on manipulating DOM elements,
which conflicts with the lifecycle that React imposes on them.
Reanimated avoids this problem by making animation part of your UI definition.

Reanimated is my opinionated claim that reaction closures are simpler
and more expressive than React's existing animation capabilities.


## Examples

[Live demos](http://timothypratley.github.io/reanimated/#!/timothypratley.reanimated.examples)
and [example code.](https://github.com/timothypratley/reanimated/blob/master/src/reanimated/examples.cljs)


## Setup

 Add to your project.clj file:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/reanimated/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/reanimated)


## API Docs

See the examples above for usage.


## How it works

Reactions. You should read about them [here.](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame)
Physical spring simulation.
Animation atom which recalculates until it reaches a steady state.
