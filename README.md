## Overview

* Concise spring animation expressions.
* Local time state, not part of your model.
* Calculates only while animating.
* This then that style timeline helper.


## The approach

React style UIs have many advantages,
but it is not always clear how to animate them.
Existing animation libraries focus on manipulating DOM elements,
which conflicts with the lifecycle that React imposes on them.
Reanimated avoids this problem by making animation part of your UI definition.

Reanimated is my opinionated claim that reaction closures are simpler
and more expressive than React's existing animation capabilities.


## Examples

[Live demos](http://timothypratley.github.io/reanimated/#!/timothypratley.reanimated.examples)
and [example code.](https://github.com/timothypratley/reanimated/blob/master/src-examples/timothypratley/reanimated/examples.cljs)


## Setup

 Add to your project.clj file:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/timothypratley/reanimated/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/timothypratley/reanimated)


## API Docs

http://timothypratley.github.io/reanimated/codox/index.html
See the examples above for usage.


## How it works

Reactions. You should read about them [here.](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame)
Physical spring simulation.
Animation atom which recalculates until it reaches a steady state.


## Development

Pull requests are welcome.

When working on src-examples navigate to dev.html:

    lein figwheel
    open http://localhost:3449/dev.html

To compile the website (keep figwheel running):

    lein cljsbuild once website
    open http://localhost:3449

Merge to gh-pages to release the website.

`lein codox` to generate the API.
`lein release` to release the library.
